**Welcome to OpenStreetMap India.**

OpenStreetMap is a company founded in 2004 project with the aim of creating a free world map. We collect data on roads, railways, rivers, forests, homes and everything else that is commonly seen on maps worldwide. Because we collect the data itself and not paint them from existing maps, we ourselves all rights to it. OpenStreetMap is the free editable map of the world.
